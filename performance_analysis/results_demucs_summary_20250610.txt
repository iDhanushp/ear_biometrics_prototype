- Macro avg: Precision 0.75, Recall 0.75, F1-score 0.75
- Weighted avg: Precision 0.74, Recall 0.74, F1-score 0.73

## Notes
- Echo-only accuracy is low, as expected with limited echo data.
- Voice-only and fused models perform well, with fused (ensemble) achieving the best accuracy (0.7386).
- Results are nearly identical to classical denoising for this dataset. Demucs did not provide a significant boost, but may help in noisier or more challenging conditions.
