## Most Practical Next Steps
1. **(Done) Implement late/hybrid fusion in your ML pipeline.**
2. **Add a simple liveness/occlusion test to your data collection.**
3. **Prototype a CNN on spectrograms for either echo or voice.**
4. **Add a noise reduction step to your feature extraction.**

## Practical Implementation Guidance

The following improvements are the most practical and impactful for your current project:

1. **Late or Hybrid Modality Fusion (Already Implemented)**
   - The system supports late/hybrid fusion: separate models for echo and voice are trained, and their predictions are combined (e.g., weighted average, voting, or meta-classifier).
   - Both training and prediction scripts support all fusion modes (echo-only, voice-only, fused, late/hybrid fusion).
   - This adds strong research novelty and ablation flexibility.

2. **Liveness Detection (Ear Occlusion Test)**
   - Already implemented: The data collection script prompts the user to record both in-ear and open-air (earbud out) samples in batches.
   - Liveness is determined by comparing energy, spectral centroid, and resonance features between in-ear and open-air samples.
   - A liveness score is computed and included as a feature for each sample.
   - Outlier and soft/automated liveness classification (e.g., logistic regression) are used to flag possible spoofing or low-confidence samples.
   - **Next steps:**
     - Continue collecting more weak/ambiguous samples to improve liveness separation.
     - Optionally, add more advanced features or classifiers for liveness.
     - Review flagged outliers and refine thresholds as needed.

3. **Deep Learning on Spectrograms**
   - Use librosa to generate mel-spectrograms from your `.wav` files.
   - Train a small CNN (e.g., with Keras or PyTorch) for classification.
   - Prototype in a Jupyter notebook or a new script.

4. **Adaptive Noise Handling**
   - Add a pre-processing step for noise reduction (e.g., spectral gating or RNNoise).
   - Integrate as a pre-processing step in your feature extraction pipeline.
