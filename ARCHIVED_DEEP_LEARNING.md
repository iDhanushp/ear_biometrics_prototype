# Archived Deep Learning Scripts and Rationale

As of 2025-06-10, all deep learning scripts (CNN/LSTM) are archived due to consistently poor performance on the current dataset. Extensive experiments with CNNs and LSTMs on both echo and voice spectrograms yielded test accuracies far below classical ML baselines, even after tuning and data/label integrity checks.

## Archived Scripts
- cnn_train.py
- lstm_train.py

These scripts are retained for reference and reproducibility, but are not recommended for use unless the dataset or spectrogram pipeline is significantly improved.

## Recommendation
Focus on classical ML models and feature engineering for robust and reproducible results.
