Comprehensive Analysis of the “Ear Canal + Voice Biometric Authentication System”
==========================================================================
Purpose & High-level Idea
Multi-modal biometric authentication that combines two independent acoustic signatures:
“Echo” = resonance pattern captured when a chirp/sine tone is played into a user’s ear canal through ear-phones.
“Voice” = a short spoken phrase.
Goal ⟹ robust user identification + basic liveness / spoof detection, without relying on cameras or fingerprints.

Technical Pipeline
Data Acquisition
Plays 0.5 s linear chirp (f500→4 kHz) → records 0.7 s echo at 44.1 kHz mono.
3-attempt retry with RMS & centroid guard; QA logged to CSV; stored as WAV + JSON.
Voice recorder re-uses same record_echo() (no tone). Each phrase sample ≈ 3 s.
Pre-processing / Noise Reduction
noisereduce spectral-gating on every clip (Demucs experiment removed).
Feature Engineering (enhanced_features.py)
MFCC 20 × (mean | std | skew | kurtosis | delta | delta²).
Re-used magnitude STFT for spectral centroid/roll-off/bandwidth/contrast/flatness.
Ear-specific: top-5 resonance peaks, magnitudes, frequency ratios.
Wavelet (db4, 5 levels), temporal (ZCR, RMS, tempo, beat count), LPC 10, chroma.
Voice extras: F0, formants (4), jitter, shimmer, HNR.
Stats on raw signal + entropy.
Output separated into echo_* / voice_; optional liveness_score (difference to matched _openair file).
Model Training (enhanced_train_model.py)
Auto extracts dataset ➜ splits ➜ scales ➜ feature-selects (default RFE k=50).
GridSearchCV per algorithm (RF, GB, SVM, KNN, MLP).
Select top-3 by CV score → soft-voting ensemble.
Saves: model, scaler, label_encoder, selector, feature_names (prefix-specific copies for echo & voice).
Generates plots (.png) & text reports.
Typical best: linear SVM voice-only ≈ 91 % accuracy; fused & ensemble ≈ 84 %; echo-only ≈ 78 %.
Prediction (enhanced_predict.py)
Loads fused model by default. On-the-fly feature extraction.
Quality heuristic: If echo RMS too low or centroid off, auto-fallback to voice-only path.
Fusion options:
fused (early)  • echo  • voice  • late (probability averaging).
Returns predicted user, full probability vector, confidence gating.
Strengths
✔ Multi-modal → higher security, lower FRR/FAR.
✔ Self-contained CLI tools; reproducible training / inference scripts.
✔ Thorough feature set, clear prefix separation enables ablation & fusion.
✔ Extensive documentation & saved artefacts → run “out-of-the-box”.
✔ QA during data capture (RMS, centroid, log) improves dataset quality.
✔ Late fusion path & auto-fallback give resilience to hardware / noise issues.
Limitations & Risks
Dataset size not stated; classical ML may overfit small per-user samples.
Liveness currently heuristic (RMS delta); no active challenge / replay-attack defence.
Deep-learning discarded due to poor mel-spec pipeline; could revive with larger dataset or self-supervised pre-training.
Device variability: recordings tied to same ear-phone type; cross-device generalisation untested.
Privacy & encryption of stored templates mentioned but not implemented in code.
Windows single-process blocking calls (sounddevice) may hinder real-time UX.
How to Run / Reproduce
# create venv & install
pip install -r requirements.txt
# collect data
python data_collector.py --user_id alice --samples 20

python enhanced_predict.py recordings/voice/user_alice_phrase_.wav --fusion_mode fused --detailed
Suggested Next Steps
Integrate real liveness: play randomised chirp or phrase, verify echo/voice sync.
Add template encryption + secure enclave storage.
Collect cross-device / cross-session dataset, evaluate domain-adaptation.
Explore lightweight CNN front-end on raw waveform + feature-level distillation (if data grows).
Wrap into REST / mobile demo; UI / UX for enrolment & verification.
Continuous authentication or health monitoring (ear canal geometry can vary with health state).
Conclusion
The project is a well-documented, research-grade prototype that demonstrates that combining ear canal resonance with voice biometrics can reach ≈ 90 % test accuracy using relatively simple classical ML. It offers ready-to-use data-collection scripts, an extensible feature-engineering pipeline, model-selection utilities, and flexible fusion at both feature and decision level. Further work on dataset size, liveness, security hardening, and cross-device robustness will be required before production deployment, but the foundation is solid for continued academic or applied exploration.
